# PPOD_Core - A LinkML Schema

This repository contains a LinkML schema for the core elements of the PPOD (Persons-Projects-Organizations-Datasets) data pattern. It is developed using [LinkML](https://linkml.io/), which is an emerging standard and toolset for describing data schemas with an orientation towards building linked data applications. LinkML data schemas are written in YAML and the framework provides tools to convert these schemas into a number of other formats, including JSON-Schema, OWL, SQL DDL, SHACL, ShEx, and Python classes.  The framework also provides tools for validating and converting data between different formats including RDF, CSV, JSON, YAML, and SQLite databases.  As such LinkML is intended as a lingua franca for interoperability between data schemas and datasets.
